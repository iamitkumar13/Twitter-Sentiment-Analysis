# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

We want to analyse the sentiment of the tweets provided from the Sentiment140 dataset using three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and SVM) 
and the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency approach (TF-IDF). After that, the effectiveness of these classifiers is evaluated using Accuracy and F1 Scores.
